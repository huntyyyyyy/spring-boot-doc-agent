# AGENTS.md

For repo working conventions (steering prompts, session log, prefer-ast-grep
citations with ripgrep allowed, state-claim gates), read `CLAUDE.md` first — it
is the source of truth and applies to every session. This file is a thin Cursor
Cloud ingest layer (gotchas + pointers), not a second SoT for recipes or counts.

## One tip branch (cloud)

Cloud agents must stay on the **single Active tip branch** for the open PR
stream (today: `cursor/local-ci-gate-fix-61f3` → PR #113). Do **not** create
sibling research-only branches that fork the same tip work; archive research on
the tip and push there. Parallel `cursor/*-61f3` branches are for **separate**
epics with separate PRs — never two checkouts of the same Cover%/gate tip.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This is a **Python 3.10+ CLI/SDK** (`doc-engine`). There is no web server or
database. Optional tools (`semgrep`, CodeQL, `gh`) may still touch the network;
do not treat “no app server” as “fully offline / no egress.” Standard
install/lint/test/run commands live in `README.md` and
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`; prefer those over duplicating them here.

### Environment layout

- Dependencies are installed into a virtualenv at `.venv/` (gitignored). The
  startup update script refreshes it. Activate it before running anything:
  `. .venv/bin/activate` (this puts `doc-engine`, `pytest`, `ruff`, `ast-grep`,
  and `semgrep` on `PATH`). Equivalently call binaries directly, e.g.
  `.venv/bin/pytest`.
- `ast-grep` and `semgrep` must be the exact pinned versions from
  `requirements.txt` on `PATH`; CI fails if a differently-versioned system
  install shadows the venv one. Inside the activated venv the pinned versions
  win — check with `which -a ast-grep` if a version gate ever complains.

### Common commands (run inside the activated venv)

- Lint / tests / E2E smoke: follow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `README.md`
  (do not hardcode suite counts here).
- **Before push** on non-docs tips: `python3 scripts/ci/pre_pr.py --auto`
  (mirrors CI hard gates: full `ruff check scripts/ src/doc_engine/`, claims,
  code quality, **domain markers**, **facade poke surface**, rule coverage,
  pytest). Do not treat a scoped pytest subset as green. `--fast` is docs-only
  — it skips markers/poke.
- Design-shaped / ambiguous research asks: follow skill
  `principal-se-research-epic` and memo
  [`docs/research/process/14-facade-poke-research-hooks-2026.md`](docs/research/process/14-facade-poke-research-hooks-2026.md)
  (arXiv + active GitHub + DeepWiki Tier C). Commit hook
  `require_design_research` blocks design-shaped commits without a Spec memo.
- **Agent policy hooks (portable):** project [`.cursor/hooks.json`](.cursor/hooks.json)
  bridges Claude PreToolUse scripts (`deny_text_search`, `deny_raw_network`,
  `check_pipe_exit_code`, `require_design_research`, `require_hardened_tests`)
  so they run on Cursor Desktop **and** Cloud. Do not rely on Claude
  third-party hook import or `~/.cursor/hooks.json` for this repo — Cloud
  only loads the project file. Policy SoT stays under `adapters/claude/hooks/`
  (+ `.claude/hooks/check_pipe_exit_code.py`); the bridge only normalizes I/O.
- Before a final commit that touches `scripts/`, `agents/`, or `skills/`, run
  `python3 scripts/ci/check_repo_claims.py` (see `CLAUDE.md`).
- Before push: `python3 scripts/ci/install_git_hooks.py` once per clone (chains
  into Cursor hooksPath when needed), then rely on `.githooks/pre-push` →
  `pre_pr --auto` (or run `pre_pr` explicitly). Force-push still runs the hook.
- If GitHub Actions is down: `python3 scripts/ci/pre_pr.py --actions-outage`
  (runbook in `scripts/README.md` — do not invent a second local-CI SoT).
- Optional local SonarQube advisory: `scripts/ci/sonar-local/README.md` (never SoT).

### Non-obvious gotchas

- `doc-engine certification verify <cert>` **rejects**
  `generative_executor` of `none` or `mock` unless you pass `--allow-mock`.
  A `deterministic_only` local run typically stamps `none`/`mock` and can still
  write `certified: true` — verify fails without `--allow-mock`. Main
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` smoke only checks that `certification.json`
  **exists** after the pipeline (it does not read `certified` or call verify).
  The separate `.github/workflows/doc-engine.yml` certification jobs **do** run
  `doc-engine certification verify --allow-mock`.
- `generative_executor="live"` is written by `doc-engine pipeline gates`
  (`live_gates.py`) for any agent that produced docs and then ran gates — not
  only the Claude Code adapter. Live generative *stages* (1–4) still need an
  LLM runtime; deterministic Stage 0 + gates do not need an LLM.
- Pipe-exit pitfall: piping build/test output into `tail`/`head`/`grep` can
  mask a non-zero tool exit (`tail` exits 0). Project hooks block that pattern
  in Claude Code **and** Cursor (via `.cursor/hooks.json` →
  `check_pipe_exit_code.py`). Safe pattern: redirect to a file and check the
  tool’s own exit code, e.g.
  `pytest tests/ -q > log.txt 2>&1; RC=$?; tail -n 40 log.txt` (see
  `docs/process/tool-quirks.md`).
