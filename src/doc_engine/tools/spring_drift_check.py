spring_drift_check.py — two-tier drift detection for spring_signals.json:
which evidence citations from a prior scan no longer match the repo.

Usage:
    python -m doc_engine.tools.spring_signal_scan <repo_path> --out spring_signals.json
    # ... time passes, repo changes ...
    python -m doc_engine.tools.spring_drift_check <repo_path> spring_signals.json --out drift_report.json

    # Or, to measure drift against the specific pipeline run that produced
    # the currently-published docs, rather than the raw scan:
    python -m doc_engine.tools.spring_drift_check <repo_path> spring_signals.json \\
        --manifest run_manifest.json --out drift_report.json

Tier 1 compares content hashes to find changed files; when anything moved,
tier 2 runs one fresh ``spring_signal_scan.scan()`` of the repo (same scanner
set as the prior signals, default ``filesystem,ast-grep``) and compares each
changed-file citation against that fresh evidence bag. No LLM calls anywhere
in this file.

WHY THIS EXISTS

Standalone tool: takes a repo path and a prior spring_signals.json (the
output of spring_signal_scan.py's scan(), schema_version >= 2) and reports
which evidence citations in that JSON have likely drifted from the repo's
current state. Not wired into the document-spring-repo pipeline, not
triggered by CI, no LLM calls anywhere in this file — every drift verdict
here comes from a content hash or a compare against a fresh Stage 0 scan,
the same deterministic tooling spring_signal_scan.py itself is built on.

WHY TWO TIERS, NOT ONE WHOLE-FILE HASH CHECK
A single file-level content hash is a correct but coarse drift signal: if
a comment three lines away from the annotation a citation actually points
at gets fixed, the file's hash changes, and a hash-only checker would flag
every citation in that file as suspect — a false-positive drift alert on
every unrelated fact the file happens to also contain. The fix is to spend
the expensive, precise check only where the cheap one says something moved:

  Tier 1 (cheap, whole-repo): re-walk the repo with the exact same
  dfs_walk() spring_signal_scan.py used, hash every file with the exact
  same compute_file_signature(), and diff against the `file_signatures`
  map stored in the prior scan. This alone answers "did anything change at
  all" for every file in the repo, in one pass, with no structural scan.

  Tier 2 (precise, per-citation): when tier 1 reports any change (or
  add/delete), run one fresh ``spring_signal_scan.scan()`` of the whole
  repo using the prior signals' ``scanners`` list (default
  ``filesystem,ast-grep``), then for each changed cited file compare the
  stored citations against the fresh evidence filtered to that file/rule —
  entity/table mapping, repository type args, query text, or annotation
  shape. This is **not** a per-file ``run_ast_grep()`` subprocess; the
  fresh bag is repo-wide and filtered down. Skip the fresh scan entirely
  when tier 1 finds nothing moved.

WHAT "ESSENTIALLY THE SAME SHAPE" MEANS, CONCRETELY
The stored `match` field (spring_signal_scan.py's _first_line_match — the
matched AST node's own first line, truncated to 200 chars) is *not* always
a distinctive per-citation fingerprint on its own. For a relational rule
like persistence__entity, the matched node is the whole class_declaration,
and its first line is just the leading annotation — "@Entity" for every
single entity in a repo, regardless of class name, because the class name
itself sits on the *second* line of the match (verified directly against
this plugin's own fixtures — every entity in test_fixtures/spring_signals/
has match == "@Entity", full stop). Comparing raw match text alone would
therefore either miss real drift (a different entity's match "covers" for
a citation whose actual entity disappeared) or over-report it. So this
tool re-derives, per rule type, the same specific identity
spring_signal_scan.py itself already extracts:

  persistence__entity        -> class name (_extract_entity), then verifies
                                 table/table_name_source didn't change even
                                 if the class itself is still there
  persistence__repository    -> repository interface name
                                 (_extract_repository), then verifies
                                 entity/id_type didn't change
  raw_queries__query         -> the extracted query string + query_kind
                                 (_extract_query) — not the raw annotation
                                 text, which is often multi-line
  everything else            -> the stored `match` text itself (for the
                                 remaining, mostly single-line-annotation
                                 rules, the full ast-grep match IS
                                 essentially that one line, so this is a
                                 meaningful comparison, not a fallback of
                                 convenience)

Comparison is multiset-based (collections.Counter), not 1:1 pairing: if a
file has several identically-shaped citations (possible for the generic
match-text case — e.g. two bare `@GetMapping` with no path arg, or several
plain `RestTemplate` usages), this tool can't claim to know which specific
original instance corresponds to which specific fresh match, and doesn't
pretend to; it reports however many of the original count are still
accounted for by the fresh count, and flags any shortfall as drifted.

WHAT HAPPENS TO CITATIONS WITH NO rule_id
Config/deployment/logging/migration-file evidence (spring_signal_scan.py's
pass 1, plain filename matching) has no ast-grep rule behind it at all —
there is nothing to re-run. For most of these, tier 2 cannot apply: if
tier 1 says the file changed, the citation is reported as
"suspected_drift_content_changed_no_rule_to_recheck" rather than silently
left unchecked or silently assumed fine. This is a deliberate, visible
fallback, not an oversight.

One specific exception: files spring_signal_scan.py recorded a
config_key_sets entry for (schema_version >= 5 — application*.yml/
properties, bootstrap*.yml/properties, and YAML deployment manifests) get
a real tier-2-style recheck instead of the generic fallback above, via
_recheck_config_keys(): the file's dotted key set is re-extracted
(_config_keys.py, no YAML dependency — see that module's docstring) and
compared against the stored snapshot. Key set changed -> reported as
"config_structure_changed" (an expected, structural evolution — keys
added/removed). Key set identical but the file's content hash still
changed -> reported as "config_values_only_changed_review_needed": the
only way that happens is a *value* changed under an unchanged key, which
in a setup where these files are checked-in placeholders and real values
are injected by an external service at deploy time is the anomalous case
worth a human look, not the routine one. A repo without config_key_sets
in its prior scan (an older schema_version) just gets the original
generic fallback — this is additive, not a hard requirement.

DERIVED CITATIONS HAVE MORE THAN ONE INPUT — PROVENANCE, NOT A SPECIAL CASE
Every rule above implicitly assumes a citation's freshness is a function of
exactly one file: its own. That's true for primary evidence (a
@RestController is present because that file, and only that file, says
so), which is why the per-file loop in check_drift() can get away with
"file unchanged -> citation unchanged." It stops being true the moment a
citation's value is *derived* from more than one file. JPQL lineage
(spring_signal_scan.py schema_version >= 6) is the first such citation:
its source_tables is computed from the query text (its own file) AND the
entity->table mapping resolve_jpql_to_lineage() looked up
(entity_table_map[entity]["file"], typically a different file entirely).
A table rename in the entity's file doesn't touch the query's own file at
all, so tier 1 alone would call that citation unchanged while its lineage
silently goes stale.

The fix generalizes the existing rule rather than special-casing JPQL:
"a citation is fresh iff every file in its provenance is unchanged" was
always the real invariant — every rule above just has provenance = {own
file} implicitly. resolve_jpql_to_lineage() stamps its result with
lineage.resolved_via_entity, so a JPQL citation's provenance is knowable
as {own file, entity_table_map[entity]["file"]} without any new stored
index. _reverify_jpql_lineage_provenance() runs once after the main
per-file loop (same reason spring_signal_scan.py itself defers JPQL
resolution to its own post-loop pass: ast-grep's match order isn't
guaranteed, so the entity's file and the query's file might get tier-2
rechecked in either order) and re-derives the JPQL citation's freshness
from fresh_entity_tables — the same class_name -> table map
_recheck_entities() already builds internally to do its own comparison,
exposed rather than thrown away, so this costs zero extra ast-grep
invocations. The outcome reuses STATUS_CONFIRMED/STATUS_DRIFTED, not a new
status: an entity file changing without its table mapping actually moving
(a comment edit, a new unrelated field) still confirms the lineage,
exactly like the false-positive-avoidance case every other rule already
handles. No new machinery is needed if a second derived-citation type ever
shows up later — it only needs to name its own provenance set the same
way.

WHY A PLAIN CONTENT HASH, NOT A GIT BLOB SHA (a design fork, resolved here)
spring_signal_scan.py's dfs_walk() reads whatever is actually sitting on
disk — uncommitted edits and untracked files included. A git blob SHA
(`git ls-tree`/`git hash-object`) only covers files tracked at HEAD: an
untracked new file has no blob SHA to compare at all, and a file with
uncommitted edits would compare against its last-committed content, not
what dfs_walk actually scanned — silently measuring drift against the
wrong baseline for exactly the repo states this scanner is otherwise happy
to run against. Both spring_signal_scan.py's compute_file_signature() and
this tool's own tier-1 re-hash use a plain sha256 of raw file bytes for
this reason — see compute_file_signature()'s own docstring in
spring_signal_scan.py for the same rationale in more detail.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
No LLM calls, anywhere. No DeepWiki-style rendered HTML output — this
writes JSON only. No GitHub Actions / CI wiring — this is a script you run
by hand, pointing it at a repo and a prior scan. All three were
deliberately scoped out of this tool; ask before adding any of them here.

OPTIONAL --manifest: WHICH file_signatures BASELINE TO TRUST
spring_signals.json's own file_signatures (the raw Stage 0 scan) is still
the default tier-1 baseline and is always sufficient on its own. But a
document-spring-repo pipeline run's run_manifest.json (doc_engine.tools.run_manifest)
independently records file_signatures too — either copied from the same
spring_signals.json, or a fresh re-hash at `finalize` time if the run
wasn't handed a --signals-file. When both exist and might disagree (e.g.
several pipeline runs happened against one older spring_signals.json scan,
or the repo changed between the scan and the run that actually produced
the currently-published docs), pass --manifest run_manifest.json to use
its file_signatures as the tier-1 baseline instead of spring_signals.json's.
spring_signals.json is still required either way, for tier-2 evidence
(evidence/entity_table_map) that run_manifest.json never carries.

This is a provenance choice, not a "prefer whichever is newer" heuristic:
run_manifest.json's target_repo.commit_hash is a record of what repo state
the run that produced the *currently published* docs actually saw, which is
the thing drift should be measured against — not just "the most recent
hash available." (Prior art: fiberplane/drift, a doc-rot linter, resolves
the same kind of multi-baseline ambiguity by preferring an explicitly
stamped provenance commit over a recency-based fallback; see
claude/drift-check-manifest-baseline-research-2026-07-25.md for the full
research this design followed.) No arXiv paper was found addressing
multi-baseline selection directly for this kind of tool — noted there
rather than overclaiming precedent.

A run_manifest.json is only trustworthy as a baseline once its run reached
a terminal state: load_manifest() rejects one still at status "running"
(finalize was never called, so file_signatures is likely still init's
empty {} placeholder) or one with an empty file_signatures map even after
finalize (e.g. finalize called without --signals-file). Same principle
OpenLineage's run-lifecycle model uses for its own RunState events (START/
RUNNING are non-terminal; only COMPLETE/FAIL/ABORT are) — see
https://openlineage.io/docs/spec/run-cycle/.

    own provenance metadata) is used from it; run_manifest.json's other fields
    (stages, evidence_tag_counts, interview, ...) are irrelevant here.

    run_manifest.py's build_init_manifest() sets file_signatures to {} and
    status to "running", and only finalize_manifest() ever changes either
    (status becomes one of "complete"/"failed"/"partial"; file_signatures is

    reliably means finalize never ran on this manifest at all, and an empty

    inputs are unchanged — the same freshness rule every other,

    one citation type that actually has a second input, rather than a
    special-cased "dependent entity" status. Mutates `results` in place;
    runs once, after the main per-file loop, so it doesn't depend on

    first (ast-grep's per-repo match order isn't guaranteed stable either —
    see spring_signal_scan.py's own JPQL-resolution pass for the same
    reasoning).

    A "changed" input file is not the only way the second input can go
    stale: DELETING (or moving, which classify_files() reports as a delete
    of the old path) the entity's file also invalidates the mapping. So the
    entity-provenance gate fires for changed_set OR deleted_set — a deleted
    entity file simply has no fresh scan, so it flows into the fresh-is-None
    -> DRIFTED branch below with a delete-specific detail. Without this, a

    "unchanged" with silently stale lineage — the exact miss this whole
    provenance pass exists to prevent, in its deletion variant.
