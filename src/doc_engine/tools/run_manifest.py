Run with: python -m doc_engine.tools.run_manifest

run_manifest.py — per-run telemetry for one document-spring-repo pipeline
invocation: target repo identity, per-stage timing/pass-fail state,
evidence-tag counts per generated file, and the interview's
answered/skipped breakdown.

Implements the schema proposed in
claude/analytics-logging-research-2026-07-24.md, itself researched against
MLflow's RunInfo, ML Metadata's Execution lineage record, in-toto's Link
predicate, and DVC's dvc.lock — see that file for the prior-art comparison.
Closes the still-open half of claude/steering-prompts/04-analytics-logging-research-prompt.md
(item 2); item 1 (drift detection) is already handled by
spring_drift_check.py.

WHY THIS IS A CLI INVOKED MANY TIMES, NOT ONE LONG-LIVED PROCESS
document-spring-repo has no single Python process spanning all five
stages — skills/document-spring-repo/SKILL.md is a prose script the
orchestrating Claude Code thread follows by hand, dispatching subagents via
the Task tool and shelling out to Stage-0 scripts via Bash. There is no
in-process object this module could hand the orchestrator to call at real
stage boundaries. So instead this is a small stdlib CLI, invoked once per
stage-start/stage-end event (plus once for `init` and once for `finalize`),
each invocation reading the current run_manifest.json, updating it, and
writing it back — the same "small script invoked via Bash from SKILL.md"
pattern spring_signal_scan.py/partition_repo.py/spring_drift_check.py
already use, just invoked repeatedly across one run instead of once.

CONCURRENCY CONTRACT (see SKILL.md's own bolded note, restated here since
it's load-bearing for correctness, not just documentation): `start-stage`
and `end-stage` must be called exactly once per named stage, by the
orchestrating thread only — never from inside a subagent, and never once
per individual parallel dispatch within a stage (e.g. not once per
file-summarizer group). Concurrent read-modify-write calls against the
same manifest file from multiple processes racing each other is not
supported by this module and will lose updates.

WHY WRITES ARE ATOMIC (temp file + os.replace), UNLIKE ANY OTHER SCRIPT
HERE
Every other script in this plugin (spring_signal_scan.py, partition_repo.py,
spring_drift_check.py) writes its output exactly once, at the very end of a
single run — an interrupted write just means "no output file yet," not
"corrupted output file." This module reads-modifies-writes the *same* file
repeatedly across a whole pipeline run; an interrupted write here would
otherwise leave run_manifest.json half-written, breaking every subsequent
stage call's `json.load()`. So every write here goes through
_write_json_atomic(): write to a temp file in the same directory, then
os.replace() (atomic on both POSIX and Windows). This is new territory for
this codebase, not an existing convention being borrowed.

WHAT HAPPENS IF THE ORCHESTRATING SESSION DIES MID-RUN
`finalize` auto-marks any stage still `status: "running"` as `canceled`
(with an explanatory `error`) and sets the overall run `status` to
`"partial"` rather than pretending the run cleanly completed or failed.
But if the orchestrating session dies *before finalize is ever invoked at
all*, there is no background process here to notice and no automatic
recovery — the manifest simply sits on disk forever at
`status: "running"`. That's a real, stated limitation of the
"CLI invoked from a prose script" design, not a bug being silently
tolerated: a human (or a future session) can still run
`run_manifest.py finalize` by hand against that file at any later point to
close it out.

Usage:

    ... (repeat start-stage/end-stage per stage) ...
