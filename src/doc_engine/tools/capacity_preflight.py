Run with: python -m doc_engine.tools.capacity_preflight

capacity_preflight.py — turn document-spring-repo's stated-but-unverified
scale assumptions into a concrete number for one specific target repo,
before committing to a full five-stage run.

CONSTRAINTS.md and skills/document-spring-repo/SKILL.md already name three
assumptions nobody has load-tested against a real large repo:
  1. Token counts are a chars/N heuristic (see partition_repo.py's
     CHARS_PER_TOKEN_DEFAULT/DENSE), not Claude's real tokenizer.
  2. build_groups() picks a planning-target group count, not a hard cap —
     a lopsided repo can end up with more groups than planned.
  3. Each Stage-1 file-summarizer dispatch carries its group's slice of
     `cross_group_edges.json` — the resolved arcs on that group's own
     boundary — on top of the group's own files.

     [Corrected 2026-07-24] Assumption 3 previously read: "the repo-wide
     `references` bucket is attached, in full, to *every* Stage-1
     dispatch." That was true when this script was written and stopped
     being true at commit abd3ade, which replaced the broadcast with a
     partitioned join in Stage 0; SKILL.md now says "Do not go back to
     broadcasting the bucket." This script kept measuring the broadcast
     anyway, and the first real-repo run measured the gap: 7,627,230 est.
     tokens reported against 358,645 actually shipped, a ~21x
     overstatement, in the direction of alarm. SKILL.md's original
     "worth confirming against a real repo" note is therefore discharged —
     it was confirmed, and the finding was that the cost was real enough
     to engineer away.

This script does not re-derive any of that logic — it imports
partition_repo.py's build_groups()/estimate_tokens()/dfs_file_list(),
spring_signal_scan.py's scan(), and build_cross_group_edges.py's
build_report() directly (sibling import, same pattern spring_drift_check.py
already uses for spring_signal_scan) and just reads their output. No new
dependency, no second implementation of the chars/N-token estimator, the DFS
walk, or the package/import join to drift out of sync with the original.

Note this measures only what is sent *in*. Nothing here estimates Stage-1
return payloads, so a run can pass preflight cleanly and still exhaust the
orchestrator on the way back — see SKILL.md's Stage 1 note on that ceiling.

Total subagent fan-out across all five pipeline stages, given num_groups
groups (see skills/document-spring-repo/SKILL.md's per-stage dispatch
description):
  Stage 1 (file-summarizer):        num_groups
  Stage 2 (architect-segment):      num_groups
  Stage 2 (architect-merge):        1  (always, serial)
  Stage 3 (gap-analyzer):           1  (always; the interview itself is
                                        the orchestrating thread, not a
                                        subagent dispatch, so it isn't
                                        counted here)
  Stage 3 (software-architect-and-testing): 1  (always; dispatched in the
                                        same turn as gap-analyzer, its own
                                        manifest stage, no interview)
  Stage 4 (doc-writer):              len(VALID_DOC_FILES)  (one per taxonomy file)
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  total = 2*num_groups + 3 + len(VALID_DOC_FILES)

[L2 / post–cross-group-edges] Stage-1 cost is the *partitioned* edge slice
(measured below). Stage-4 doc-writers still receive a merged evidence pool
(summaries, spring_signals, interview_answers — see pipeline stages.py
doc_writer input_artifacts) on *each* of the taxonomy writers. Measuring
only Stage-1 therefore under-states Stage-4 input load.

This script runs at **Stage 0**, before summaries/interview exist. It
reports a **partial_proxy_pre_stage4** for shared-pool size: sum of group
`est_tokens` (source-token *proxy* for future summaries; overlap can
inflate) plus optional signals chars/N. It does **not** estimate
interview_answers, architecture/merge text beyond that proxy, or Stage-4
return payloads. Field names keep `*_upper_bound_*` for the numeric warn
threshold; `stage4_metric_kind` is the honesty label — do not treat a
quiet proxy as closed Stage-4 capacity risk. Cite north-star domain
`07-partitioning-and-skew`, `rel-partition-bounds-fanout`,
`claims-and-status-drift`.

Every threshold below is a stated, tunable guess pending real-world
calibration (documented as such, not hidden) — this script surfaces
numbers and warns; it never blocks or refuses to run the actual pipeline.

Usage:
    python -m doc_engine.tools.capacity_preflight <repo_path> [--max-tokens 120000]

        [--stage0-preflight-report capacity_preflight_report.json]
        [--out capacity_preflight_report.json]

L2b — when --summaries-file is set, run post-artifact Stage-4 *measurement*
(metric_kind measured_stage4_inputs) against on-disk summaries / optional
interview_answers / optional signals. Stage-0 partial_proxy_pre_stage4 is
unchanged for pre-run estimates. Do not invent interview sizes at Stage 0;
do not change the default --stage4-shared-tokens-warn-threshold without a
documented mid-size run. Cite rel-partition-bounds-fanout.
