semantic_eval_helpers.py — the mechanical pre-pass for the
semantic-pipeline-eval skill.

test_pipeline_stages.py already proves an [Evidenced — path:line] citation
*resolves* to a real file/line; it explicitly does not judge whether the
claim next to that citation is actually *true*, whether a
[Confirmed — interview, <date>] tag is really backed by a real interview
answer, or whether two doc-writer files quietly contradict each other.
Those three are genuine semantic-judgment tasks and belong in
skills/semantic-pipeline-eval/SKILL.md's own LLM-driven steps, not here.

But two sub-checks that sound semantic are actually mechanical, and doing
them with an LLM would be wasted judgment budget:

1. find_unmatched_confirmed_tags() — matching a [Confirmed — ...] tag's
   claim text against interview_answers.json's entries is a string/overlap
   lookup, not a judgment call about truth.
2. check_mermaid_syntax() — checking a Mermaid block's bracket/subgraph
   balance, plus whether every edge endpoint is a labeled node somewhere in
   the diagram (find_undefined_node_refs()), is a grammar/structural check,
   not a rendering or semantic judgment. Deliberately not a full Mermaid
   parser (no new dependency) — structural only, sufficient to catch the
   failure class it exists for. Note this is deliberately narrower than
   test_pipeline_stages.py's find_untraceable_nodes(): that function checks
   whether a *labeled* node's label text traces back to a real file/class
   name (a semantic traceability check, already covered there — not
   duplicated here); find_undefined_node_refs() only checks whether a node
   *has* a label at all, a purely structural question.

Running this first narrows what semantic-pipeline-eval's own LLM-driven
Step 2/3/4 actually has to look at, the same "mechanical wherever possible,
narrow LLM-judge only where genuinely needed" split
claude/steering-prompts/01-testability-research-prompt.md already
prescribed for test_pipeline_stages.py.

ASSUMED interview_answers.json SHAPE (not schema-validated anywhere in this
project — see claude/steering-prompts/02-pluggability-research-prompt.md's
still-open "no schema, no validation" gap; this is a consumer of that
prose-only contract, not a fix for it): a JSON array of objects, each with
at least `topic`, `question`, `status` ("answered" or "skipped"), and
(when answered) `answer` and `date` — per skills/document-spring-repo/
SKILL.md's Stage 3 description of what the orchestrator records.

Run with:
    python -m doc_engine.tools.semantic_eval_helpers <artifacts_dir> [--target-repo <path>]
                                      [--out mechanical_findings.json]

<artifacts_dir> is expected to contain interview_answers.json, docs/*.md,
and architecture.md (or a file containing a fenced ```mermaid block) — the
same PIPELINE_ARTIFACTS_DIR layout test_pipeline_stages.py's opt-in
real-artifacts pass already uses. --target-repo is accepted for CLI-shape
parity with that layout and reserved for semantic-pipeline-eval's own
LLM-driven citation-truthfulness step (Step 2 of that skill) — the two
mechanical checks in this file don't need it themselves.
