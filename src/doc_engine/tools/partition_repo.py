Run with: python -m doc_engine.tools.partition_repo

partition_repo.py — adaptive, token-bounded, DFS-ordered file grouping with overlap.

Implements the grouping scheme described in Pan, Mao, Ma & Ling,
"ArchAgent: Scalable Legacy Software Architecture Recovery with LLMs"
(arXiv:2601.13007), Section 3 ("Adaptive Grouping"):

    1. Calculate total token count T of the repository.
    2. Define a maximum token threshold M (bounded by the target model's
       context window).
    3. Partition into G = ceil(T / M) groups.
    4. Traverse the file tree via DFS, maintaining ~10% overlap between
       adjacent groups so the merge stage has shared context to stitch on.

Token counts here are estimated with a cheap heuristic (chars / N) rather
than a real tokenizer, since this only needs to be "close enough" to size
groups sensibly — it is not used for anything that requires exact counts.
No third-party dependencies for default behavior, so it runs anywhere
Python 3 does. The optional --respect-gitignore flag is the one exception:
it needs the `pathspec` library installed, and degrades to a no-op (with
default exclude behavior unchanged) if that library isn't available.

N depends on content density rather than being a flat 4 for everything —
see CHARS_PER_TOKEN_DEFAULT / CHARS_PER_TOKEN_DENSE below for what that's
based on and why. G itself is also only a planning estimate, not a hard
cap: build_groups() will emit more than G groups if the actual content
needs it rather than let a group silently exceed max_tokens (see the
is_last_group_being_filled comment there).

Two bugs in build_groups() were found and fixed by validating this script
against a real repository's actual file tree rather than only synthetic
scenarios (a small, uniform hand-built file list doesn't expose either
one — both need genuinely lopsided real-world file sizes to surface):
the final group had no size ceiling at all (is_last_group_being_filled
used to suppress it unconditionally), and separately, the overlap-carry
step could duplicate a single oversized file into several consecutive
groups instead of carrying a small trailing slice (see the long comment
above the `carried + tok2 >= max_tokens` check inside build_groups()).
Both have permanent regression tests in test_partition_repo.py
(test_final_group_no_longer_unbounded, test_overlap_skips_oversized_
trailing_file) using small synthetic repros, plus an opt-in real-world
validation pass in test_partition_repo_real_world.py that is what
actually surfaced the second bug in the first place.

Usage:
    python -m doc_engine.tools.partition_repo <repo_path> [--max-tokens 120000] [--overlap 0.10]
                               [--out groups.json] [--exclude-dir NAME ...]
                               [--max-file-bytes 2000000]

# Chars-per-token divisors, calibrated against a real BPE tokenizer
# (tiktoken's cl100k_base — used only offline to pick these constants, not
# a runtime dependency of this script) run against real and synthetic Java,
# Python, YAML, JSON, and .properties files.
#
# What that measurement actually found, char-weighted:
#   Java (6 real production files):        ~5.0 chars/token
#   Python:                                 ~4.1-4.5 chars/token
#   YAML (7 files, real configs):           ~2.4 chars/token
#   JSON (3 files):                         ~3.6 chars/token
#   YAML+JSON+.properties combined:         ~2.9 chars/token
#
# That does NOT support "code under-counts relative to prose" as a general
# rule — Java/Python came out at or above 4 chars/token, meaning the old
# flat chars/4 already over-estimates their token cost, which is the safe
# direction for a budget this heuristic exists to protect. The real,
# measured gap is specifically in dense structured-data formats
# (YAML/JSON/properties): chars/4 under-counts those by roughly a third,
# which is the risky direction — it makes a config-heavy group look
# cheaper than it actually is. This divisor split targets that specific,
# measured gap rather than a blanket code-vs-prose adjustment.
#
# Caveat worth keeping in mind if you revisit this: cl100k_base is a proxy
# for "a real modern BPE tokenizer's behavior," not Claude's own tokenizer
# — there's no offline Claude tokenizer available to calibrate against
# directly. The relative ordering (structured data denser than code or
# prose) is a robust, general property of BPE tokenization and not
# specific to one vocabulary, but the exact divisor values are an
# approximation, not a guarantee.
