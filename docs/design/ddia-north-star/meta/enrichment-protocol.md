# Enrichment protocol

1. Prefer **deepening an existing `id`** over adding overlapping pages.
2. Add a new concept only if no existing “When to open” covers the question.
3. Add a **relationship** page when the hard part is the *edge* between two concepts/artifacts, not either endpoint alone.
4. Always update `completeness` and `last_refined` in frontmatter.
5. If the page is a chapter, keep the required 5W1H H2 sections honest — do not mark `operational` while Why/How are stubs.
6. Project-specific chronology stays in `claude/research/*-memo-*.md` and **cites** north-star ids — this catalog is not a second STATUS.md.
7. Intentional DDIA divergence → [deviations/](../deviations/) entry in the **same change** when practical.
8. Rebuild `catalog.json` via `_build_catalog.py` and keep the sync test green.
9. Domain README must list every concept and relationship under that domain.
10. **Remedies required (E-SOL0 / SOL11).** Every operational `concept`, `relationship`, and `playbook` page MUST include an `## Effective remedies` section that names at least one mechanism id from [effective-remedies.md](effective-remedies.md) (`fitness-function`, `single-write-derive`, `characterization-net`, `adequacy-witness`, `sensor-ledger-spec`) plus Accept shape — not Applications/Fail-if alone. Diagnosis without a remedy is incomplete enrichment. Chapters/domains stay vocabulary; they point here via related concepts.
