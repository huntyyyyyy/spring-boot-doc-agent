# INDEX — multi-axis router

Load [README.md](README.md) first. Prefer a **domain**, then one page. Cite its `id` **and** a remedy from [meta/effective-remedies.md](meta/effective-remedies.md). Check [deviations/](deviations/) when departing from Core claims.

## By level (start here if unsure)

| Level | Start |
|-------|--------|
| Product / direction | [README.md](README.md) + [meta/usage-levels.md](meta/usage-levels.md) |
| Concern → **remedy** | [meta/effective-remedies.md](meta/effective-remedies.md) (required for Spec Accept) |
| Domain | [domains/](domains/) (`01`…`10`) |
| Subdomain / concept | domain README → one `concepts/` page → its **Effective remedies** |
| Relationship | domain `relationships/` or playbook |
| Control / gate | [playbooks/](playbooks/) |
| Upstream diagnosis | [deviations/](deviations/) + `rel-conflict-vs-recompute` |

## Filed deviations

| id | Summary |
|----|---------|
| `dev-coverage-denominator-codeql` | Coverage SoR ≠ `rule_fixtures` / YAML count |
| `dev-certification-derived-view` | Certification is derived; no LWW with facts |
| `dev-fp-ratchet-separate-from-recall` | FP ratchet inverted & separate; no fake recall baseline |
