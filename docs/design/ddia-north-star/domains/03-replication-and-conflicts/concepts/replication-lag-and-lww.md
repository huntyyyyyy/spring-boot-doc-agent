# Replication lag and last-write-wins

## In one sentence

Async copies introduce lag anomalies; resolving conflicts by “latest timestamp wins” silently discards concurrent writes.

## When to open

- Merge strategies for concurrent updates to the same artifact.
- Whether to LWW-merge certificates/stages vs re-derive.
- Multi-writer docs (STATUS vs queue).

## Core claims

- Lag can break read-your-writes, monotonic reads, and causal prefix reads.
- LWW is lossy conflict resolution — concurrent updates are dropped, not merged.
- Prefer conflict avoidance, explicit merge, or CRDT/OT when correctness matters.
- Derived recompute from a single fact log avoids LWW between writers of the view.

## Tradeoffs

- Sync replication / consensus costs latency and availability.
- LWW is simple and wrong for many integrity domains.
- Manual merge needs operability.

## Repo analogues

- B2.5: certification as derived fold — not LWW merge + stamp (`certification-derived-view-2026-07-30.md`).
- Content-stable claim fingerprints vs ordinal renumber churn.
- Do not let STATUS and adoption-queue “win” by recency; correct the derived view.

## Review checks

- Fail if two writers of the same fact are reconciled by silent last-write-wins without a filed deviation.
- Fail if a dual writer, silent LWW, or vacuous gate ships without a deviation or SoR fix.

1. Are there two writers for one key?
2. If concurrent edits are possible, is the resolve rule stated (and is it LWW)?
3. Would derive-from-facts remove the conflict class?
- Fail if the Core claims are ignored without a filed deviation.
## Refactor signals

- `dict.update` / merge helpers on cert or manifests without fold rules.
- “Last session’s STATUS paragraph” overriding the queue SoR.

## Anti-patterns seen

- Pre-B2.5 live cert merge stamped `generative_executor: live` without deriving stages.

## Effective remedies

- **Primary:** `single-write-derive` — eliminate dual write; fold from facts, never silent LWW.
- **Embodied:** certification fold (B2.5); one tip writer.
- **Accept:** concurrent writers need an explicit fold rule or a single SoR — LWW is Refuse for integrity domains.
- **Research:** SOL3 in `docs/research/process/23-concern-to-solution-remedies-2026.md`.
