# Maintainability: operability, simplicity, evolvability

## In one sentence

Maintainability splits into making operations possible, keeping accidental complexity down, and making change cheap as requirements move.

## When to open

- Is this control operable by humans/agents without folklore?
- Big-bang vs sequenced change.
- Complexity that slows every later edit.

## Core claims

- Operability: good ops can work around incomplete software; good software rarely survives bad ops.
- Simplicity: accidental complexity raises bug and schedule risk (ball of mud).
- Evolvability: requirements churn — design for change at system boundaries, not only local TDD.
- Automation helps but escalates the skill needed for residual edge cases.

## Tradeoffs

- More abstraction ≠ more simplicity.
- One mega-PR vs many reversible slices.
- Docs that are not operable (wrong paths) destroy evolvability of process.

## Repo analogues

- Packaging pause; adoption-blocker sequencing B1–B5 then L1…
- `pre_pr` / CI hard suites as operability.
- North-star load protocol: one page, not whole tree.

## Review checks

- Fail if STATUS or CONSTRAINTS claim a control is done while the owning test or script still contradicts that claim.
- Fail if a dual writer, silent LWW, or vacuous gate ships without a deviation or SoR fix.

1. Can a new agent run the check from README/CI alone?
2. Does the change reduce or increase interlocking assumptions?
3. Is there a rollback/derive path?
- Fail if the Core claims are ignored without a filed deviation.
## Refactor signals

- Undocumented cwd-dependent behavior.
- Controls that only work on one engineer’s checkout path.

## Anti-patterns seen

- CI comments pointing at deleted fixture paths.

## Effective remedies

- **Primary:** `fitness-function` (structure) + `characterization-net` before reshape.
- **Embodied:** tach cycles; size/complexipy; E-COH cohesion bar; façade poke.
- **Accept:** reshape Specs cite characterization + seam map (SOL5); not “move files until green.”
- **Research:** `docs/research/process/15-legacy-size-remediation-2026-frameworks.md`.
