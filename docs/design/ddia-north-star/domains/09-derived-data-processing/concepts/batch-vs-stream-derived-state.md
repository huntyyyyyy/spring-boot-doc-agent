# Batch vs stream derived state

## In one sentence

Batch derives large views when freshness can lag; streams keep views continuously updated from an append-only log of facts.

## When to open

- Offline backtests vs hermetic CI fixtures.
- Whether a control should be periodic recompute or incremental.
- Immutable inputs for safe reprocessing.

## Core claims

- Batch fits ETL, training, reconciliation — high volume, delayed freshness.
- Serving derived data: stage then load; avoid live row-at-a-time writes from batch into production SoR.
- State is the fold of events; immutability of the log enables rebuild and audit.
- One log, many consumers/views — evolution without rewriting producers.

## Tradeoffs

- Batch-only → stale operational truth.
- Stream-only everywhere → operational complexity where overnight jobs suffice.
- Mutable “fixups” of history without a log → unauditable.

## Repo analogues

- Hermetic fixture non-vacuity/FP = small batch over committed corpus (CI).
- Real-corpus recall backtest = large batch on a dev machine; commit baseline not corpus.
- Dual-emit `facts.jsonl` beside signals = ledger-friendly SoR for later folds.

## Review checks

- Fail if a dual writer, silent LWW, or vacuous gate ships without a deviation or SoR fix.
- Fail if freshness is unspecified yet a stream/batch choice is treated as settled.
- Fail if derivation cannot be replayed from immutable inputs.
- Fail if a bulk job writes the SoR directly instead of staging a derived view.

## Refactor signals

- CI depending on an untracked client checkout name.
- Mixing recall and precision into one batch without separate baselines.

## Anti-patterns seen

- Inventing a client-named recall baseline instead of hermetic FP fixtures (L1).

## Effective remedies

- **Primary:** `single-write-derive` with stage-then-load/swap for serving views.
- **Embodied:** batch CI fixtures vs live generative stages; certification derived.
- **Accept:** batch jobs never write live SoR “for convenience.”
- **Catalog:** [meta/effective-remedies.md](../../../meta/effective-remedies.md).
