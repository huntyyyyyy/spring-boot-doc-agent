# Encoding and compatibility

## In one sentence

Shared schemas make multi-writer/multi-reader evolution tractable; schemaless convenience shifts the cost to runtime failures and tribal knowledge.

## When to open

- Pydantic / JSON Schema for artifacts.
- Semgrep/check_id path prefixes and id conventions.
- RPC vs event vs DB dataflow boundaries.

## Core claims

- Schemas (even simple ones) beat ad-hoc JSON for evolution across languages and time.
- Dataflow mode matters: DB retains old values; RPC often assumes shorter-lived skew; events need compatible envelopes.
- Reader/writer version skew is normal — design for it.
- Validation without gate bite is debt (schema memo).

## Tradeoffs

- Heavy schema upfront vs open-world bags (`spring_signals` stays open; `facts.jsonl` closed).
- Exporting JSON Schema without Stage wiring → false confidence.

## Repo analogues

- `ARTIFACT_MODELS`, `scripts/schemas/`, facts closed contract.
- Semgrep `__` ids so `check_id.rsplit(".", 1)[-1]` is cwd-safe.
- Baseline JSON schemas for ratchets.

## Review checks

- Fail if a JSON/artifact field is renamed or removed without a compatibility/migration note for existing readers.
- Fail if a dual writer, silent LWW, or vacuous gate ships without a deviation or SoR fix.

1. Is the artifact open-world or closed-world on purpose?
2. Does a schema change keep old readers/writers working?
3. Is validation invoked on the live path that matters?
- Fail if the Core claims are ignored without a filed deviation.
## Refactor signals

- Free `dict` at a boundary that already has a model.
- Schema file with no caller.

## Anti-patterns seen

- Review helper existed while Stage 5 omitted it (B4 closed).

## Effective remedies

- **Primary:** `fitness-function` on schema/compatibility predicates + additive evolution.
- **Embodied:** claim fingerprints content-stable; baselines carry `schema_version`.
- **Accept:** breaking readers requires Explicit Defer or dual-read window — not silent rename.
- **Catalog:** [meta/effective-remedies.md](../../../meta/effective-remedies.md).
