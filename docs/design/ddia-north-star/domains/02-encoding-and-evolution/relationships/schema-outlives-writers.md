# Relationship: schema outlives writers

## In one sentence

Schemas and on-disk artifacts persist across code deploys; writers and readers must stay compatible across skew.

## Who

Schema owners, writers (producers), readers (consumers / gates), migration owners.

## What

Edge: `Schema --constrains--> Writer/Reader` across versions; additive evolution preferred under skew.

## When

Any baseline, JSON schema, ratchet file, or fixture format change.

## Where

`*.schema.json`, coverage baselines, certification shapes, Pydantic models, `<!-- derived: -->` keys.

## Why

Data (and baselines) outlive the PR that wrote them; breaking readers without a migration is a production incident in slow motion.

## How

1. Prefer additive fields with defaults.
2. Bump `schema_version` when semantics change.
3. Provide a migration or dual-read window — do not “fix CI” by inventing fake SoR numbers.

## Anti-band-aids

- Fail if a dual writer, silent LWW, or vacuous gate ships without a deviation or SoR fix.

## Repo path witness

- [Repo] `domains/02-encoding-and-evolution/relationships/schema-outlives-writers.md`

## Effective remedies

- **Primary:** additive schema + dual-read windows; `fitness-function` on baseline schema_version.
- **Accept:** delete writer only after readers tolerate absence.
- **Catalog:** [meta/effective-remedies.md](../../../meta/effective-remedies.md).
