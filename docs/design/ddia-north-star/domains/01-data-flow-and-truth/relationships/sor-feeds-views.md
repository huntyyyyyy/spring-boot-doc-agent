# Relationship: SoR feeds views

## In one sentence

One writer (SoR) produces facts; zero or more derived views recompute or materialize for readers — views never become a second writer.

## Who

- **Writer:** the SoR owner (ruleset, facts.jsonl, gate inputs, schema SoR).
- **Readers:** humans, CI comments, STATUS, certification, coverage baselines, dashboards.
- **Accountable on conflict:** SoR owner; view maintainers recompute.

## What

Edge: `SoR --derives--> View`. Not: `View --overrides--> SoR`.

## When

Design time (choose homes), CI (regenerate views), incidents (do not LWW-merge).

## Where

Pipeline facts → certification; CodeQL ids + spring_signals → coverage results; code → STATUS/CONSTRAINTS prose (derived claims).

## Why

Dual writers create silent drift; LWW hides which fact was true (`replication-lag-and-lww`).

## How

1. Name the SoR path.
2. Name the view path and regenerator.
3. On disagreement: fix SoR or regenerator — never hand-merge the view without a [deviation](../../deviations/).

## Anti-band-aids

- Fail if a dual writer, silent LWW, or vacuous gate ships without a deviation or SoR fix.

## Repo path witness

## Effective remedies

- **Primary:** `single-write-derive` — edge SoR→view is unidirectional.
- **Accept:** view PR names SoR inputs + rebuild command; reverse write is Refuse.
- **Catalog:** [meta/effective-remedies.md](../../../meta/effective-remedies.md).
