# System of record vs derived data

## In one sentence

The system of record holds each fact once as the canonical source; derived data is recomputable from that source (caches, indexes, materialized views, trained models).

## When to open

- Is this file/artifact authoritative, or a recomputable view?
- Docs say X but code reads Y — which is SoR?
- Should we merge two writers or re-derive from facts?

## Core claims

- SoR (source of truth): new input is written here first; representation is typically normalized; on discrepancy, SoR wins by definition.
- Derived: transformed/processed from another system; if lost, it can be rebuilt from the source.
- Derived data is redundant but often essential for read performance; one SoR can feed many views.
- Analytical systems are usually derived; operational services often mix SoR and derived.

## Tradeoffs

- Treating a derived view as SoR → silent drift and dual writers.
- Refusing all derived data → unusable read latency / scan cost.
- LWW-merging two SoR candidates → lossy (see `replication-lag-and-lww`).

## Repo analogues

- SoR: rule YAML / CodeQL `rule_id`s, fixture corpora, stage/gate facts, `facts.jsonl`.
- Derived: `certification.json` (B2.5), STATUS/CONSTRAINTS prose, CI comments, coverage baselines, `<!-- derived: -->` counts.

## Review checks

- Fail if a new artifact is introduced without naming its single writer and whether it is SoR or derived.
- Fail if a dual writer, silent LWW, or vacuous gate ships without a deviation or SoR fix.

1. Does the diff name a single writer for each fact?
2. If two artifacts can disagree, is it clear which wins?
3. Can the “view” be deleted and rebuilt from stated inputs?
- Fail if the Core claims are ignored without a filed deviation.
## Refactor signals

- Dual homes for the same claim (docs path ≠ gate path).
- Hand-edited counts that should be derivations.

## Anti-patterns seen

- `rule_coverage` docs claimed `rule_fixtures/` while runtime reads `scripts/fixtures/spring_signals/` + CodeQL ids.
- STATUS “Next engineering” lagging after B1–B5 landed on the queue.

## Effective remedies

- **Primary:** `single-write-derive` — one authoritative writer; views recompute ([meta/effective-remedies.md](../../../meta/effective-remedies.md)).
- **Embodied:** oracle `coverage.xml` vs climb XML (**16-A**); certification as derived fold.
- **Accept:** Spec names SoR|derived for each new artifact; refuse a second authoritative API.
- **Research:** `docs/research/process/23-concern-to-solution-remedies-2026.md` (SOL3).
