# Materialized views and caches

## In one sentence

A materialized view is a stored query result kept in sync with underlying facts so reads avoid recomputing the join or scan every time.

## When to open

- Multiple consumers need different shapes of the same facts.
- A gate “view” over a ruleset (non-vacuity vs FP vs recall).
- Caching / dual indexes / fan-out on write.

## Core claims

- Materialization trades write amplification (update each follower/view) for read latency.
- One immutable fact log (or SoR) can feed several read-optimized views without changing producers.
- Caches and denormalized timelines are derived; they must be invalidate/rebuild-safe.
- Serving derived data should stage then load/swap — not hammer live SoR row-by-row from batch.

## Tradeoffs

- More views → more sync/lag surface.
- Stale view without monitoring → operators think SoR is wrong.
- One helper with two polarities (recall vs FP) → silent wrong gate.

## Repo analogues

- Positive non-vacuity, FP ratchet, and recall ratchet = three materialized checks over one ruleset.
- `certification.json` fold over stage/gate facts.
- `entity_table_map` / edges as derived joins (historically LLM-inferred → deterministic).

## Review checks

- Fail if a coverage/certification baseline is hand-edited instead of regenerated from stated SoR inputs.
- Fail if a dual writer, silent LWW, or vacuous gate ships without a deviation or SoR fix.

1. Is each view’s input set and refresh rule stated?
2. Are polarities separate (e.g. drop-to-zero vs rise-above-baseline)?
3. On failure, can you tell “view lag” from “SoR corruption”?
- Fail if the Core claims are ignored without a filed deviation.
## Refactor signals

- Collapsing two ratchets into one function “with a flag”.
- Writing production artifacts from a batch/scan without a staging step.

## Anti-patterns seen

- Semgrep recall `check_ratchet` is not an FP ratchet; L1 adds `check_fp_ratchet`.

## Effective remedies

- **Primary:** `single-write-derive` + separate **adequacy-witness** polarities per view.
- **Embodied:** positive / FP / recall as distinct measurements over one ruleset.
- **Accept:** new view declares rebuild inputs + fail direction; never overload one helper for inverted polarities.
- **Catalog:** [meta/effective-remedies.md](../../../meta/effective-remedies.md).
