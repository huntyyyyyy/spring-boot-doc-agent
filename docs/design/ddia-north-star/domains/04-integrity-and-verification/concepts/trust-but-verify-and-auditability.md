# Trust, but verify (and auditability)

## In one sentence

Assume components usually keep their promises, but design so integrity can be checked end-to-end — because local ACID or a green CI step does not stop application-level corruption or vacuous gates.

## When to open

- A gate that can pass by checking nothing.
- Certification / coverage claims without witnesses.
- “The database is serializable so we are safe.”

## Core claims

- System models state what may fail; verify rather than trusting marketing.
- End-to-end argument: strong storage properties do not fix buggy writers.
- Event/log style improves auditability when derivation is deterministic and replayable.
- Immutable append-only inputs limit blast radius of bad code vs overwrite-in-place.

## Tradeoffs

- Verification has cost (fixtures, ratchets, oracle compares).
- Over-verification without witnesses → theater.
- Under-verification → confidently wrong docs (this repo’s stated principal risk).

## Repo analogues

- Non-vacuity + invented-rule tests; FP ratchet; `check_repo_claims` mechanical half.
- Live cert fail-closed; strict citations on compliance profiles.
- Prompt 10 evidence tiers A/B/C.

## Review checks

- Fail if a CI gate cannot be shown to fail on a planted counterexample in the same change.
- Fail if a dual writer, silent LWW, or vacuous gate ships without a deviation or SoR fix.

1. What would a vacuous pass look like for this control — is it tested?
2. Is there a witness (fixture, counterexample, failing case)?
3. Can a later session re-run the check without tribal knowledge?
- Fail if the Core claims are ignored without a filed deviation.
## Refactor signals

- Soft-pass on missing baseline for a gate that claims to enforce precision.
- Skipping binary-dependent tests without `skipTest` (false green).

## Anti-patterns seen

- Positive-only semgrep coverage: rules can fire, FPs unmeasured until L1.

## Effective remedies

- **Primary:** `adequacy-witness` + `fitness-function` (planted counterexample / mutation / metamorphic).
- **Embodied:** metamorphic suite; mutmut advisory; `check_repo_claims`; G2 AST witness.
- **Accept:** gate change ships with a witness that fails closed on a known bad case.
- **Catalog:** [meta/effective-remedies.md](../../../meta/effective-remedies.md) (SOL4).
