# Relationship: gate needs witness

## In one sentence

A trust or coverage claim is only as strong as its **witness corpus** and failure direction; gates without witnesses are vacuous.

## Who

Gate author, CI maintainer, reviewer who asks “what would make this fail?”

## What

Edge: `Claim --proven_by--> Witness` (positive fixtures, negative fixtures, ratchet baseline, audit log).

## When

Adding or changing any CI gate, ratchet, or “we verified X” prose.

## Where

`rule_coverage`, `semgrep_rule_coverage`, `check_repo_claims`, live_gates, certification verify.

## Why

Without a witness, green CI means “script ran,” not “property holds.”

## How

1. Name the property.
2. Name the witness path and the bad direction (drop vs rise).
3. Separate witnesses when properties invert (`dev-fp-ratchet-separate-from-recall`).
4. Refuse gates that can only pass.

## Anti-band-aids

- Fail if a dual writer, silent LWW, or vacuous gate ships without a deviation or SoR fix.

## Repo path witness

## Effective remedies

- **Primary:** `fitness-function` + `adequacy-witness` (fixture, mutant, metamorphic, AST).
- **Embodied:** G2 prelude leak witness; rule_coverage fixtures; metamorphic.
- **Accept:** new gate documents witness path + fail direction (SOL2/SOL4).
- **Catalog:** [meta/effective-remedies.md](../../../meta/effective-remedies.md).
