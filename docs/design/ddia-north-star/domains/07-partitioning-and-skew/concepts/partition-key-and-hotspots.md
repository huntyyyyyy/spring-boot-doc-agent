# Partition key and hotspots

## In one sentence

The partition key decides which shard owns a record; a bad key creates permanent hotspots that no cache band-aid permanently fixes.

## When to open

- Choosing how to split Stage-0 groups / Stage-1 dispatches.
- A single group or key path dominates latency or token cost.
- Temptation to “just raise the fan-out threshold” after one hot partition.

## Core claims

- Partitioning scales by splitting data/work; the key choice dominates skew.
- Hot keys / celebrity keys overload one partition while others idle.
- Rebalancing moves partitions — it is an operational event, not free magic.
- Overlap in group planning (this product) can double-count files in upper_bound estimates — label them as such.

## Tradeoffs

- Fine partitions → more fan-out and cross-partition coordination.
- Coarse partitions → simpler ops, higher hotspot risk.
- Hashing spreads load but hurts range queries and locality.

## Repo analogues

- `partition_repo.build_groups` planning target vs actual group count under skew.
- Stage-1 edge slice **max** (one hot group) vs total (sum) in `capacity_preflight`.
- Stage-4 shared-pool **upper_bound** after merging all group summaries — quiet Stage-1 ≠ quiet Stage-4.

## Review checks

- Fail if a partition key is chosen without naming the hot-key / skew plan.
- Fail if only the Stage-1 slice sum is cited while ignoring the max single dispatch.
- Fail if Stage-4 shared-pool upper_bound is omitted when arguing capacity is fine.

## Refactor signals

- One group’s `est_tokens` or edge slice dwarfs peers.
- Raising `--fanout-warn-threshold` / `--group-warn-threshold` without Stage-4 measurement.

## Anti-patterns seen

- Preflight that measured only Stage-1 after cross-group edges landed, under-stating Stage-4 load (adoption L2).

## Effective remedies

- **Primary:** `fitness-function` on measured bounds + refuse threshold band-aids.
- **Embodied:** Stage-1 slice stats vs Stage-4 upper_bound honesty; no broadcast reintroduction.
- **Accept:** hotspots fixed by key/design change or Explicit Defer — not silent warn-threshold raises.
