Tests for _ast_signature.py.

These are the evidence for a design decision, kept executable. The choice of
t2 as the default was made from measurements taken in a throwaway script --
and a measurement made once in a scratch file decays exactly the way a claim
written in prose does, which is the failure this whole subsystem exists to
stop. So every measurement that justified the decision is a test here, and
re-runs on every commit rather than resting on a number in a commit message.

Written to skills/directional-tests/SKILL.md: each test names the property it
defends, and the ones that matter would go red if the property broke rather
than if a line stopped executing.
