"""Assertion-engine mutants for spring-signals/harness/check-assertions.py.

Taxonomy note: this is *not* the gate-mutator harness
(`scripts/ratchets/mutate.py`) and *not* formatting perturbations
(`java_perturbations.py`). Oracle = kill mutants in check-assertions. Not
PIT-class Java SUT mutation. See CONTRIBUTING.md “Mutation-scope taxonomies.”

Applies each named mutant to the engine in place, runs the test suite,
verifies the mutant is killed, and restores the pristine source. Run from the
repo root:  python tests/spring_signals/mutation_driver.py

ENFORCE = False -- see the CI step name, which says "non-blocking". Survivors
are reported but do not fail the job until a threshold is defended. A missing
anchor (driver stale vs. engine) still exits non-zero: that is a broken tool,
not a soft score.
