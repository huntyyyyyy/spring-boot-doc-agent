check_llms_coverage.py — fails when a merged PR has no docs/process/pr-verification/pr-N.md,
or when a pr-N.md's frontmatter `state:` says OPEN for a PR that's actually
merged.

WHY THIS EXISTS
docs/process/pr-verification/pr-*.md creation has always been a manual, judgment-heavy step
(see docs/process/pr-verification/README.md) — nothing forced it to happen, so it silently
didn't: PRs #9-12, #14, and #15 all merged with no corresponding pr-N.md,
and pr-13.md's frontmatter was left saying `state: OPEN` after PR #13 itself
merged. verify_llms_docs.py re-verifies commands inside files that already
exist; it has no way to notice a file that was never written, or a stale
frontmatter field, at all. This script is the completeness check that closes
that gap — mechanical coverage, not content quality (a pr-N.md that exists
but is thin or wrong is still out of scope here, same boundary
verify_llms_docs.py draws around its own "Expect:" prose).

GRACE WINDOW FOR THE MOST-RECENTLY-MERGED PR
A PR that adds a missing pr-N.md is itself a newly-merged PR with no pr-N.md
of its own — a PR cannot document its own merge commit before that commit
exists. Enforcing zero-gap coverage literally would mean every single PR
forever needs an immediate, separate follow-up PR whose only content is
documenting the PR before it (this happened for real, twice: PR #16 then
PR #17). To break that regress, the single most-recently-merged PR (by
`mergedAt`, not PR number — GitHub PR numbers are assigned at creation and
don't strictly track merge order) is exempt from both checks below. This
bounds the real requirement to "covered before the *next* PR merges" rather
than "covered before this PR's own CI run finishes," which is impossible.
See docs/process/pr-verification/README.md for the companion convention (write a PR's own
pr-N.md in the same PR, pinned to its head commit) that makes this
exemption rarely even necessary in practice.

REQUIRES: `gh` on PATH with GH_TOKEN in the environment to list merged PRs
non-interactively (same requirement verify_llms_docs.py's `gh pr view` calls
already have — see .github/workflows/ci.yml).
