check_repo_claims.py — makes a stale claim about this repo's own state
impossible to commit, rather than recorded after the fact.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/ci/check_repo_claims.py
    python3 scripts/ci/check_repo_claims.py --fix       # rewrite derived blocks
    python3 scripts/ci/check_repo_claims.py --update    # re-baseline
    python3 scripts/ci/check_repo_claims.py --metrics   # measure, never gate

Checks: derived blocks recompute, verify: predicates hold, references resolve,
every test suite is wired into CI, no CI step is named as a gate it cannot fail,
agents keep Bash scoped and cannot raw-network via Bash, and tracked markdown is UTF-8.
Claims are read from a registry of corpora (CLAIM_CORPORA) -- steering-prompt
frontmatter and CONSTRAINTS.md's bracket tags today.

WHY THIS EXISTS
This repo does not have a record-keeping problem. Its record is unusually
good: an append-only docs/process/session-log.md, a docs/process/tool-quirks.md index,
a bracket-tagged CONSTRAINTS.md, and status frontmatter on every steering
prompt. Every failure below happened anyway, with the record right there.

  - docs/process/steering-prompts/06-wiredrift-check-task-prompt.md carried
    `status: not started` after the work had landed. The session log
    flagged it three separate times (2026-07-25 "Sync STATUS.md...",
    and twice more) before anyone edited the field. Logging caught it
    three times and fixed it zero times. 07 and 08 went the same way.
  - CLAUDE.md's own rule *against* hardcoded counts was itself written
    with a stale count, on the day it was written.
  - 12-review-session-launcher.md told a fresh session to read two
    steering-prompt files that did not exist, after a renumbering.
  - CONSTRAINTS.md cited verify_llms_docs.py after it was deleted, so
    the file contradicted itself in two places.

The common shape, in the log's own words (docs/process/session-log.md, the
citation-coverage entry): "every tag form is auditable, and no tag is
not. Omitting a tag is always the locally cheapest move." Generalized: a
claim about repo state costs nothing to write and nothing ever reads it
back. So another log is more of the thing that already failed. This reads
the claims back.

THE DERIVED BLOCK, AND WHY IT IS NOT AN INJECTION VECTOR
Flagging a stale number is still just reporting. Generating it is the fix:

    The workflow runs <!-- derived: ci_test_steps -->17<!-- /derived --> suites.

check_derived_blocks() recomputes each one and fails on mismatch; --fix
rewrites them. A stale count cannot survive CI, and correcting one is a
command rather than a repo-wide sweep.

This repo already deleted a script for the obvious-but-wrong version of
this idea. verify_llms_docs.py extracted fenced spans out of LLM-authored
markdown and ran them through `bash -c` with GH_TOKEN in scope on every
PR; matching was by prefix, so any `;` in a span was arbitrary code
execution. It was removed rather than hardened, and .github/workflows/ci.yml
still carries the tombstone ("do not re-add it").

So markdown here never carries a command. A derived block names a *key*,
constrained to [a-z0-9_]+ by the regex itself, which is looked up in the
DERIVATIONS dict below. An unknown key is an error, never a silent skip.
The markdown can only select a derivation this file already implements;
it cannot introduce one. No shell, no eval, no format-string evaluation.
test_check_repo_claims.py pins that property directly.

WHAT IS CHECKED
  A derived-block drift      — a committed number that no longer recomputes
  B unresolvable references  — a backticked repo path or symbol that is gone
  C verify: predicates       — a steering prompt's status vs. decidable facts
  D CI suite coverage        — a test suite that CI never runs
  E gates that can fail      — an ENFORCE=False script named as if it blocks
  F agent Bash scope / network — scoped ast-grep allow + curl/wget/git-clone deny
  G UTF-8 text contract      — tracked markdown must be valid UTF-8 (no crash)

WHAT IS NOT CHECKED, DELIBERATELY
Whether a [Resolved] tag is *true*. Well-formedness is decidable; truth is
not. That stays a human judgment, and CLAUDE.md keeps asking for it. This
script narrows where to look; it does not decide. Same boundary
check_pipeline_output.py draws against semantic-pipeline-eval.

THE BASELINE, AND WHY THERE IS NO ENFORCE TOGGLE
Check B over a repo that is 38-54% deliberate prose finds real history on
day one. Cleaning all of it would be a repo-wide prose churn burying the
mechanism in its own diff, so findings present at adoption are recorded in
repo_claims_baseline.json and only *new* ones fail — the same ratchet
check_code_quality.py already uses, for the same reason.

That is the only softening. ``check_llms_coverage.py`` is advisory via an
always-zero ``exit_code()`` (``ENFORCE`` was removed) — findings report but
never fail the step. This script is local, deterministic, needs no network,
and makes zero LLM calls, so it blocks from day one. A step named as a gate
that cannot fail is worse than no gate — which is precisely what check E
exists to keep true of everything else in ci.yml (it detects ``ENFORCE =
False``; advisory-by-always-exit-0 is documented here and in STATUS).
