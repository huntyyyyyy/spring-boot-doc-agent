java_perturbations.py — **formatting perturbations** (Type-1 / meaning-preserving).

Taxonomy note: this is *not* the gate-mutator catalog (`mutate.py` /
`gate_mutators.py`) and *not* assertion-engine mutants
(`tests/spring_signals/mutation_driver.py`). These edits measure drift FP /
metamorphic Arm 1. They are not PIT operators. See CONTRIBUTING.md
“Mutation-scope taxonomies.”

Library-only: imported by test_drift_normalization.py, never run, so it carries
no Usage: block by design (CONTRIBUTING.md's docstring contract exempts modules
with no __main__ entry point).

WHY THIS EXISTS

spring_drift_check tier 2 answers "did this citation actually move?" for a file
tier 1 saw change. It is only worth having if it says no when nothing moved. To
measure that, you need edits whose correct answer is known in advance:

  FORMATTING_ONLY   a Type-1 clone in Zhang & Saber's taxonomy (arXiv:2506.14470
                    section II-A): identical except for formatting and comments.
                    Every "drifted" verdict after one of these is a false
                    positive, with no judgement call involved in scoring it.

  DELIBERATELY_BROKEN
                    not formatting-only, and not honestly labelled as such. See
                    below -- these exist to test the harness, not the checker.

WHY A BROKEN PERTURBATION IS SHIPPED ON PURPOSE

The first version of wrap_annotation_args rewrote annotation-looking text
*inside comments*. That broke a doc comment's closing quote, left the file
unparseable, and made ast-grep return nothing -- so every citation in the file
read as drift. The measured false-positive rate came out at 7/208 when the true
figure was 2/208: a 3.5x overstatement, caught only by opening the files by
hand.

The lesson is that "this edit preserves meaning" is a claim about the harness,
and an unverified claim about the harness is indistinguishable from a finding
about the checker. So broken_wrap_annotation_args is kept, exactly as it was
written, as a test input: test_drift_normalization.py asserts that the validity
gate REJECTS it. A gate that has never been shown to reject anything is not a
gate.
