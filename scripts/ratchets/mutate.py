"""Break things on purpose, in a sandbox, and report which tests failed to notice.

Usage:

    python3 scripts/ratchets/mutate.py --filter grep   # only mutators whose name matches

ENFORCE = False -- see the CI step name, which says "non-blocking".

WHY THIS EXISTS

This repo's standing rule is that a gate which cannot be shown to fail is not
a gate, and it is satisfied by hand: an author breaks the code, watches the
tests go red, restores it, and writes down what happened. Three separate
documents say so and name mutation testing as the mechanised form --
skills/directional-tests/SKILL.md, steering-prompt 10, and
claude/testing-security-anchors-2026-07-25.md, which puts it plainly: "mutation
testing, executed by a human, once, with no artifact proving it was ever done."

The ritual was performed at least four times while this file was being
written, and the evidence was deleted each time.

WHY NOT mutmut

mutmut mutates Python. The defects this repo has actually had did not live in
Python: an agent regaining the Grep tool (markdown frontmatter), a rule's
argument-bearing pattern deleted (YAML), a derived: block edited (markdown),
ENFORCE = False without a "non-blocking" step name (CI YAML). A Python-only
mutator scores zero on all four. This harness is artifact-aware for that
reason. mutmut remains the right complement for the pure-Python modules and
is not replaced by this.

SANDBOXED, ALWAYS

Every mutation is applied to a copy of the tracked tree in a temp directory,
never to the working tree. The manual ritual relied on try/finally and a
steady hand; a crash between break and restore left the repo silently broken.
Only git-tracked files are copied, which keeps the copy small (the working
tree may contain a multi-hundred-megabyte target repo) and keeps a concurrent
session's untracked work out of the run -- the same reasoning
check_code_quality.py gives for measuring tracked files only.

ONE SUITE PER MUTATION

Each mutator names the suite that should catch it, and only that suite runs.
Running all of them per mutation would multiply the whole suite's runtime by
the number of mutators for no extra information. A mutation caught by a
*different* suite than the one named is reported separately: the mutation was
noticed, but the ownership map is wrong.

A SURVIVOR IS A TEST GAP, NOT A BUG

A surviving mutation means the code changed and every test still passed. That
is a statement about the tests, not the code.

    Data this file interprets, never behaviour a document supplies -- the same
    boundary check_repo_claims.py draws around its predicates.

    `lang` decides HOW the defect is located. Set it to an ast-grep language
    and the anchor is a structural pattern rewritten with `ast-grep --rewrite`,
    so reindenting or reflowing the target cannot quietly detach the mutator
    from the code it is supposed to break. Leave it empty and the anchor is a
    literal string.

    The literal cases are not laziness, and each one below says why:
      - markdown, where ast-grep's grammar matches broad block nodes. Measured
        on this repo's README: a pattern for `ast-grep` reported 35 lines of
        which 27 contained no such string. A rewrite driven by that would edit
        the wrong text.
      - the ast-grep rule file itself, where the text to match *contains*
        `$$$ARGS`. That is ast-grep's own metavariable syntax, so a structural
        search for it does not mean what it reads as.

    Both are covered instead by test_mutate.RegistryAnchorsTest, which fails
    the build when a literal anchor drifts out of the file it names.
