"""PreToolUse(Bash) hook: block commands that read a build/test tool's exit code through a pipe.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
This exact mistake produced two false "green" reports in one session on this project:

    gradle stage0Oracle --console=plain | tail -30
    echo "GRADLE_EXIT=$?"

`$?` after a pipeline is the *last* command's exit status -- `tail`'s, not Gradle's. Both
failed runs printed "GRADLE_EXIT=0" because `tail` always exits 0. The failure was only caught
later by noticing the log file was empty, which is not a check anyone should have to remember
to perform by hand.

WHAT THIS DETECTS
-----------------
A pipeline whose head looks like a build/test/verification tool, ending in a filter
(`tail`/`head`/`grep`/`wc`/`sed -n`/...) that discards the head's exit status, with no
recognized escape hatch present anywhere in the command (`PIPESTATUS`, `set -o pipefail`).

WHAT IT DOES NOT TRY TO DO
---------------------------
This is a heuristic over the command string, not a shell parser. It will have false positives
(an `npm ls | grep foo` a user genuinely doesn't care about the exit code for) and false
negatives (anything creative enough to dodge the regex). That asymmetry is deliberate: a false
positive costs one corrected command; a false negative is silent, which is the failure mode this
guards against. When blocked, the model can immediately switch to the safe pattern (redirect to
a file, capture $? on the actual command, then read the file) and retry -- this does not require
a human in the loop.

HEREDOC BODIES ARE DATA, NOT COMMANDS
--------------------------------------
This hook blocked its own author writing this exact docstring's *earlier* draft into
docs/process/tool-quirks.md via `cat >> file <<'QUIRK' ... QUIRK`: the heredoc body quoted the phrase
"gradle ... | tail" as prose describing the bug, and an unstripped regex read that quotation as
a live command. hooks/deny_text_search.py already hit and fixed the identical mistake for a
different matcher ("Treating text as executable is the same category of mistake that got
verify_llms_docs.py deleted"). Heredoc bodies are stripped before matching for the same reason.
