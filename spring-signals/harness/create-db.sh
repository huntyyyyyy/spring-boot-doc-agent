# Build a CodeQL database for a Java repository.
#
# Defaults target ocs-api-service and therefore need Artifactory credentials.
# Every input is overridable so the same script builds a database for the
# credential-free fixture in harness/fixture-repo (see create-test-db.sh).
#
#   REPO            source root to extract              (default: $PWD)
#   BUILD_COMMAND   command CodeQL traces               (default: the ocs gradle build)
#   DB              database output path
#   CODEQL          codeql executable
#   SOURCE_DIR      subdirectory counted for the extraction check (default: src)
#   PACKS           pack search root, for the coverage query
#   STRICT_EXTRACTION  1 (default) = a nonzero delta fails the build
#
# Why an explicit --command instead of autobuild, for the ocs default:
#   - build.gradle sets `options.compilerArgs << "-Werror"` on BOTH compileJava
#     and compileTestJava, with Error Prone 2.10.0 wired in via net.ltgt.errorprone.
#     Autobuild picks its own task set and can miss compileTestJava entirely,
#     which silently drops the test sources from the database.
#   - Java toolchain is pinned to 17 in build.gradle. The CodeQL CLI's own JVM is
#     independent of the toolchain Gradle provisions; both must be present.
#   - `installGitHooks` is a dependency of compileJava and writes into .git/hooks.
#     In a detached CI checkout that task can fail; -x it there.
#
# Artifactory credentials are required to resolve com.elsevier:* dependencies.
# Extraction quality degrades badly without them: unresolved types become
# <unknown>, and every typeIsOrExtends() predicate in the pack silently
# under-matches. Verify resolution BEFORE trusting any count.
#
# Credentials are passed through the ENVIRONMENT, not through --command.
# Interpolating a password into the traced command line puts it in `ps` output
# and in the build log CodeQL writes inside the database directory.
# Gradle reads ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_<name> as project property <name>.
