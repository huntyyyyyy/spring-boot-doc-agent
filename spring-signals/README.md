# spring-signals

Semantic signal extraction for JVM services, structured as a language-scoped
CodeQL library pack plus per-framework query packs. Wave 1 targets
`ocs-api-service` (Spring Boot 2.7.18, Java 17, `javax.*`).

## Row schema

Every wave-1 query emits the same eleven columns. This schema, not the QL, is the
contract that a future ast-grep rule set or `python-signals-lib` implements.

    file, start_line, end_line, source_set, schema_version,
    rule_id, framework, generation, symbol, signal, detail

`NativeSql.ql` appends two SQL-specific columns (`schema_refs`, `uses_json`).

`symbol` is the join key and is ALWAYS `Schema.qll::symbolOf`; `signal` is what
was detected (annotation FQN, type FQN, property key). They were one column in
the first draft, which is how `Persistence.ql` came to emit a class name in one
branch and `javax.persistence.Column` in another. See docs/SYMBOLS.md.

`schema_version` exists because waves 1-2 ship two row shapes in one pack.
Decoders branch on it; they must not infer shape from column count.

`generation` is populated only where it drives a burndown metric. Blank means
*not tracked on a version axis*, never *unknown*.

## Run

Static invariants first — no CodeQL CLI required, and the source of every
framework-reference figure quoted in the docs:

    python3 harness/check-invariants.py

It locates the pack by searching for `codeql/packs/java-signals-lib`, so it runs
from `harness/`, from the pack root, from an unrelated working directory, or
from a review overlay where a copy of the script sits beside an extracted
`spring-signals/`. If none of those apply, pass the root explicitly:

    python3 check-invariants.py --root path/to/spring-signals

An earlier version computed its root as `__file__/../..`, which meant a copy
mirrored to the top of a review archive died with a bare `FileNotFoundError`
from inside check 2 — an error describing neither the real problem nor the fix.

Then the parts that need a toolchain. The credential-free fixture gate:

    ./harness/create-test-db.sh

The ocs-api-service run (needs Artifactory credentials):

    export artifactory_user=... artifactory_password=...
    ./harness/create-db.sh
    EXPECTATIONS=harness/expectations/ocs-api-service.json ./harness/run.sh
    python3 harness/join_openapi.py \
      --api-surface out/ApiSurface.csv \
      --openapi src/docs/api/OASv3/ocs-api-service.yaml

Offline floor remeasure (ast-grep only — no Artifactory; E-OCS0 OCS6):

    # pointer or env to a local checkout (never commit the path)
    echo /path/to/ocs-api-service > local-runs/real-repo.path
    python3 scripts/ci/remeasure_ocs_floors.py              # dry-run proposal JSON
    python3 scripts/ci/remeasure_ocs_floors.py --write       # operator-reviewed

Unified plant entry:

    ./harness/run-plant.sh fixture   # CI SoR
    ./harness/run-plant.sh ocs       # preflight; blocked without checkout/Artifactory

## Status

`codeql query compile` is green against `codeql/java-all` 9.2.x, and the
credential-free fixture gate (`harness/create-test-db.sh` — pinned jars, javac,
fixture database, wave-1 queries, JSON assertions) runs locally and in CI.

Still open from the wave-1a exit criteria: `create-db.sh` on ocs @ develop,
which needs Artifactory credentials and cannot run in this repo's CI. The
constructs that were flagged as compile risks at design time are now pinned by
the QL unit tests under `packs/spring-signals/test/`:

- `getASourceSupertype*()` and `getSourceDeclaration()` in `Types.qll`.
- `regexpCapture` group semantics in `Schema.qll::sourceSetOf`.
- `getReceiverType()` on `MethodCall` in `NativeSql.ql`.
- `TypeLiteral.getTypeName()` in `ErrorHandling.ql`.
- The `concat`-over-empty-set-returns-`""` idiom used throughout `attr()`.

Meta-annotation resolution ships in two halves.

**Documented half — always on.** `SpringMetaEdges.qll` hardcodes Spring's
published meta-annotation graph (`@RestController` → `@Controller`,
`@SpringBootApplication` → `@Configuration`, mapping shortcuts →
`@RequestMapping`, and so on). Contract-backed, no probe needed, claimable in
wave 1. This is what keeps the closed state from being a recall regression
against the pack it replaces.

**Discovered half — gated.** `metaResolutionEnabled()` is `none()`, disabling the
transitive walk over extracted annotation metadata. That walk depends on CodeQL
extracting annotations on *library* annotation types, which is unverified. Run
`codeql/packs/spring-signals/Probe.ql` and record its output before flipping it.

So the closed state is exact match ∪ the contributed edges, not exact-only. Recall over
meta edges outside the table — project-local composed stereotypes, uncatalogued
third-party annotations — is the only thing that must wait for the probe.
