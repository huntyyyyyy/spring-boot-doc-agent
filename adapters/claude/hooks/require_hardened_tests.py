"""PreToolUse hook: refuse a commit that skipped the hardening this repo requires.

Reads a hook payload on stdin; denies `git commit` when a fast, mechanical
precondition fails, and names the skill to load when it does.

WHY THIS EXISTS

Every control in this repo that depends on someone remembering has eventually
been forgotten, and the record says so: prompt 06's status was flagged three
times before anyone edited it, CONSTRAINTS.md cited a deleted script in two
places at once, and this file's own author -- in the session that added the
mutation harness -- shipped a complexity regression, propagated a measured
number that was wrong, and wrote three assertions that were false within
minutes of being written.

The response this repo prescribes for a repeat failure is not another note. It
is an enforced control. So the checks below run at the moment of commit rather
than when someone thinks to run them.

WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHY ONLY THESE

Speed is a correctness property here: a gate slow enough to resent is a gate
people route around. The full suite takes about two minutes, so it is NOT run.
These are all fast, and each maps to a failure this repo has actually had:

  1. a staged scripts/*.py with no test_<module>.py under tests/  -- code added untested
  2. a staged test_*.py outside pyproject testpaths         -- wrapper revival
  3. check_repo_claims.py                             -- a claim nothing reads back
  4. check_code_quality.py                            -- a silent complexity ratchet break
  5. control-plane staged without non-vacuous receipt witness -- empty suite logs
     still counted as "observed" (E-TEL / E-CPL0)

FAIL OPEN ON ERROR, CLOSED ON A FINDING

An internal error here must not wedge the session: if this hook cannot do its
job it gets out of the way, and the CI-side gates still stand. A real finding
is different -- that is the thing it exists to stop.

Usage: wired from .claude/settings.json; not run by hand.
